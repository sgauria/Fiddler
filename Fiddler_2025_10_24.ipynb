The “+110” odds mean that for every $100 you bet on Raleigh to win MVP, you’ll win $110 if he actually wins.

This makes sense if you consider the extreme case - e.g. only 1% of the money is on Cal. Then the payout when Cal wins will be pretty small even after the amplification factor. Since the money at stake on Aaron (99%) is much larger than the amplified amount (2.1%), so equalizing them will mean an nonsensical bet on Aaron."
