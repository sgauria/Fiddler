    "E.g. to pick a particular point (e.g. (0.5,0.5)), we must first pick the first level circle that contains it, and then the next level circle that contains it, etc. This could be that we first pick the \"2\" circle, then we pick the \"3\" circle, and then repeatedly pick the \"3\" circle at each level. Since this is on a boundary, there is also one other route to this same point from the other side, but likely with much more complex choices.\n",

Which is correct for all \"interior\" points, but not correct for \"boundary\" points. Now, it may still yield a close approximation of the result given that boundary points may be a small fraction of all points, but it is a dubious assumption in this fractal situation.\n",

    "On further thought, maybe the fraction of points where the second circle affects the score in a material way is still quite small, because in most of the boundary cases, the \"other\" circle will be very small. So, it may still be fine to ignore these points as an infinitesimal fraction of the full set of points. In any case, I am not sure I have a better alternative plan."
