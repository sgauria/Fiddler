    "Anita the ant is going for a walk in the sand, leaving a trail as she goes. First, she walks 1 inch in a straight line. Then she rotates counterclockwise by an angle ùùã, after which she walks another 2 inches. She rotates counterclockwise an angle ùùã again, after which she walks 3 inches. She keeps doing this over and over again, rotating counterclockwise an angle ùùã and then walking 1 inch farther than she did in the previous segment.\n",
