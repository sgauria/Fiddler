    "A game of bingo typically consists of a 5-by-5 grid with 25 total squares. Each square (except for the center square) contains a number. When a square’s number is called, you place a marker on that square. The goal is to get “bingo,” which is five squares in a row, either across, down, or along one of the two long diagonals. The center square, which doesn’t have a number, is labeled “Free,” and begins with a marker on it before any numbers are called. Here’s an example of a winning 5-by-5 grid in which 10 squares (other than the “Free” square) have been marked:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a smaller version of the game with a 3-by-3 grid: a “Free” square surrounded by eight other squares with numbers. Suppose each of these eight squares is equally likely to be called, and without replacement (i.e., once a number is called, it doesn’t get called again).\n",
    "\n",
    "On average, how many markers must you place until you get “bingo” in this 3-by-3 grid? (The “Free” square doesn’t count as one of the markers—it’s “free”.)\n",
