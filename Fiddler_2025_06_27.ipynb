    "It’s a good thing your accomplice was able to steal the numerical key code to the vault. Earlier in the day, they handed you this code on a scroll of paper. Once at the keypad, you remove the scroll from your pocket and unfurl it. It reads: “IIIIIIIIII.” That’s ten vertical marks, without any clear spacing between them.\n",
