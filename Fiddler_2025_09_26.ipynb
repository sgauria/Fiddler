    "Earlier this week, I was playing the board game Risk with one of my kids. At the end of each turn in the game in which you conquer at least one enemy territory on the board, you are dealt a card.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 42 territory cards in the deck—14 that depict an infantry unit, 14 that depict a cavalry unit, and 14 that depict an artillery unit. Once you have three cards that either (1) all depict the same kind of unit, or (2) all depict different kinds of units, you can trade them in at the beginning of your next turn in exchange for some bonus units to be placed on the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are randomly dealt three cards from the 42, what is the probability that you can trade them in?\n",

    "**This Week’s Extra Credit**\n",
    "\n",
    "The full deck of Risk cards also contains two wildcards, which can be used as any of the three types of cards (infantry, cavalry, and artillery) upon trading them in. Thus, the full deck consists of 44 cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must have at least three cards to have any shot at trading them in. Meanwhile, having five cards guarantees that you have three you can trade in.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are randomly dealt cards from a complete deck of 44 one at a time, how many cards would you need, on average, until you can trade in three? (Your answer should be somewhere between three and five. And no, it’s not four.)"
